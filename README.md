This is a research project where our team of three from Monash University Malaysia are developing three machine learing algorithm which is **Neural Network**,**K-Nearest Neighbours** and **Random Forest**. We have developed three algorithm which is located in three different files in the main file which are named Neural-Network-Iris , K-Nearest-Neighbour-Iris and Random-Forest-Iris. You can download the files individualy and host them on any code editor. Libraries needed are listed at the first block of each algorithm, please make sure you installed them.
